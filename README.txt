Running the Project
To run this project please make sure that you have an External Library properly mapped to the JavaFX sdk lib folder.
Once this is mapped to the correct spot if you don't already have the JavaFX extension, that will need to be downloaded
from the store inside of the IDE. Once these two steps are completed and you've made sure that you have your project
set up as a Java Project you are now ready to click on the "Debug" or "Run" button to play Dots and Boxes.

If you have any issues please run the debugger and trace any errors as needed through the console window.
