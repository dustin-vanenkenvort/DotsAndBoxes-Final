Dots and Boxes
Created By: Dustin VanEnkenvort & Aaron Reel

Running the Project
To run this project please make sure that you have an External Library properly mapped to the JavaFX sdk lib folder.
Once this is mapped to the correct spot if you don't already have the JavaFX extension, that will need to be downloaded
from the store inside the IDE. Once these two steps are completed and you've made sure that you have your project
set up as a Java Project you are now ready to click on the "Debug" or "Run" button to play Dots and Boxes. Lastly, you
need to click the first dot that you choose and the click once on the 2nd to get the line that you desire. Basics
of the game is that is switches back and forth after every turn, unless you complete a box. Then you get another turn
and a point! Have the most points at the end of the game and you'll be the winner!
If you have any issues please run the debugger and trace any errors as needed through the console window.

Alpha to Beta
From Alpha to Beta our major accomplishment is now we are able to track the scores of the players while playing, once
these scores add up to 16, the highest number you can get there is a message prompting you that the game will end once
the message is closed. From our critiques on Alpha we now have a README text file within the project that lists features
of the game. Also, we've focused on the game logic so we can determine the score and a winner through arrays.

Known Issues
A known issue within the game is that it seems the game won't crash, but it will no longer switch turns
or let you choose another line to continue the game. Another issue we know that is under the covers of the game, is that
we don't have any code outside of the controller. We tried countless times on if there was a way to make it so we could
change variables from outside of the controller, to this we had no avail.

We hope you enjoy our take on the game Dots and Boxes, please feel free to contact us if there are any further questions
that we can answer. Thanks!
